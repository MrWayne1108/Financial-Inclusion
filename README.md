# Financial-Inclusion
Project for NMS Hackathon
Our team made a compound interest calculator using Python. It helps figure out how debt grows over time. Just input your numbers, and it does the math for you!
It also helps us to understand the benfits of simple interest over compound interest, for the borrower.
